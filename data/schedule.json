From the baseball management vision of Branch Hickey to the glassblowing vision of Dale Chihuly to the engineering design vision of Steve Jobs, iconoclasts have changed our world in subtle and profound ways, sometimes loudly, sometimes quietly. For an industry that seems so ripe and so rife with 'special personalities', it would seem that programming is tied up deeply with iconoclasm. But what defines the iconoclast, what demarcates the 'true' iconoclast from the mere pretender, and how can we use the characteristics of the iconoclast to change our own immediate surroundings for the better?",

How and where do you deploy these applications ? What are the concerns around firewall, DNS and routers ? How do you debug message exchanges ? What to do if WebSocket is not supported in the browser or app server ? Debugging and Production tips ? Learn about phantom WebSockets.</br></br>This university session is for you! Here is what we'll cover:</br></br>Introduction to WebSocket</br>WebSocket using JSR 356</br>WebSocket using Undertow/WildFly</br>WebSocket using Atmosphere</br>Surviving Firewall and Proxy</br>WebSocket Debugging</br>WebSocket Production Tips",

So why not use existing cheap technology to build your own wearable Java-powered device? This session shows what you can do with affordable technology and Java today. It uses a Raspberry Pi in combination with a heart rate sensor and a GPS sensor to track the heart rate and the location of a runner. The battery-powered Pi measures the data and publishes it via MQTT to different clients such as Java(FX)-based desktop clients and a smartwatch the runner can wear. Come get some ideas of what you can do with Java and wearable devices.",
